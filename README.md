[Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

**Warning:** This is in early development and it is possible it won't be
finished if there is no interest. Don't use this in production! Please help or
leave a star to let me know you are interested in this project.

Installation
------------

## Usage

Check the
[template repository](https://github.com/yewprint/yewprint-template)

build script.**

to get started very quickly:

```
cargo generate --git https://github.com/yewprint/yewprint-template.git
```

## Development Environment

```
cargo xtask start
```

You can now go to http://localhost:8000
