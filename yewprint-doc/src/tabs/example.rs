                                3000 BC to c. 1450 BC until a late period of decline, \
                                finally ending around 1100 BC. It represents the first \
                                advanced civilization in Europe, leaving behind massive \
                                building complexes, tools, artwork, writing systems, and \
                                a massive network of trade. The civilization was \

                                the work of British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans. The \

                                was coined by Evans, who identified the site at Knossos \
